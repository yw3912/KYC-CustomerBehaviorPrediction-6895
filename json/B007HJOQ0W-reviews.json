In all fairness, that is the feature that excited him the most, but he kept saying they were easy to write with and his hand wasn't as tired after using it. I do my best to get my kids school supplies that they enjoy using because I know how much more I enjoy my own work when I have tools and supplies that work well or I like for whatever reason. So while a pencil choice might sound a bit silly, I see it as a way of encouraging my kids at school.Compared to other pencils, these aren't exactly cheap, so I initially picked up a 2 pack at a local store, hoping my son would get his fascination with the twist eraser out of his system and this would be the end of it. But when I actually used the pencil? Well let's just say it's the first time in my life I've said 'Wow' after writing with a pencil. It's so incredibly smooth! It actually writes smoother than many pens I've used. And it does not break nearly as easily as most other pencils we've used, mechanical or wooden. So off to Amazon I went to purchase more at a better price, because mom wants a few of these pencils now, too.Now, personally, I'm not super jazzed about the twist eraser as the eraser likes to twist itself out while in my purse (not all the way out, but out enough that I have to twist it back in before each use). This is probably because I don't use pencils often so it sits in my purse getting jostled around for quite a while before it gets pulled out. My son does not have this issue with the ones in his backpack, as he uses them every day at school. He also uses the eraser a lot, so having an extra long eraser is not only 'cool', it's practical for him.One could just buy the strong-yet-buttery-smooth lead refills and put them in a cheaper pencil, if you don't have need or desire for the extra eraser. But this pencil is also very comfortable in my hand, lightweight and balanced well, so I haven't bothered to do that personally.

I decided to try this pencil because it had a .9mm lead and I thought that it just MIGHT help with the lead breaking problem so I ordered one. Well, it worked very well for the breakage problem. I haven't broken a lead since I started using this pencil. However, I have discovered other great benefits. The new retracting eraser smooths the whole erasing thing out nicely and makes eraser longevity and changing much less of a problem. The larger soft rubber grip also makes the pencil a LOT easier to hang on to, especially for those with my condition.One improvement I have learned to make on the grip: The fattest part of the grip, as it comes, is at the top and doesn't add to the ergonomics of holding the pencil much. I have found that if you simply unscrew and remove the bottom of the pencil where the lead comes out, the rubber grip can simply be slipped off, turned around and reinstalled. Now the fat part of the grip is at the bottom and keeps the fingers in a more sure and comfortable position. The way the manufacturer delivers them doesn't make sense in this respect.However, this pencil is a quantum leap in usability over every other pencil I have ever used and I have since thrown out every other pencil in the house and replaced them with this one.Thank you Pentel for making a better product to simplify our lives.", "people_count": 42, "image_usage": 0, "written_date": "July 18, 2012", "product_index": 0}, {"title": "Great mechanical pencil!", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "customer_id": "M.

I was hesitant to purchase this one, the \"Express XP\", since it was not the same item I was used to.The original, if taken apart would be four pieces (apart from led/eraser). This pencil is only three pieces, since the pocket clip (now a more flexible plastic) is one piece with the upper barrel. BTW, the eraser that fitted the original also fits the Express XP.I've seen the original pencils sell for $3.00 apiece, but this set was a dozen for much less. So a cheaper and simpler design, construction, and material.But when it comes to performance, this pencil has a flaw. With every one of these pencils I had, both my wife and I experienced that sometimes the lead would break inside the tip so it would be stuck in the tip. This happened A LOT--if it didn't I wouldn't mention it or feel the need to edit my original review (which was five stars by the way, but the one who uses an item for years is not the same as the one who uses it for a day or two). But when the lead gets stuck, how do you dislodge it? First, unscrew the tip. Now look inside the removed tip and you'll see that there is a piece of lead in there and you should not be able to see through the lead hole. Then you have to take another mechanical pencil of the same width, get the lead to protrude about a centimeter, and then carefully push that lead into the tip from where it normally writes. Eventually the broken lead will fall out. It's possible to do this cumbersome operation without a second pencil, i.e. with the original, but you have to have more lead in the barrel, pull back on the clinging apparatus, push the barrel as if you're going to push out some lead, now hold it so that some lead will begin to fall out, about a centimeter or so, and then continue as mentioned above. If you don't want to fiddle around with this BS--imagine you're on a bus or in a classroom taking a test or following a fast-talking lecturer and all of a sudden the lead gets stuck like this. Don't waste your time.
