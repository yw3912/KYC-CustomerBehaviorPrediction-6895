Apparently those are not common sizes and even looking for them in open stock was not resulting in anything I liked. I am very pleased with these as they are kind of a universal basic black simple design. I measured their content capacity because some of the other reviewers thought they may not be as big as they claim to be but they are. The nonstick seems quite solid. The handles are very sturdy and they are heat safe so that you will be able to put your hand on them without using a hot pad which is important to me; I dislike sauce pans that have metal handles that require you to get out a hot pad every time cuz I always forget. One thing someone commented about was that the handle is heavy enough that the one quart saucepan over balances on the stove and that is true but it has been true of every one quart saucepan I've ever had because if the handle is sturdy it's just going to be that heavy. Now if you have an induction cook surface I believe there may be a problem with the two quart. The one quart seems to have a solid bottom but the two quart has little metal circle inserts, and if the structure is what I think it is, only those little circles will be triggered by the induction cooktop. That means if you're trying to saute something in it, only those exact spots will get hot though if you are warming a liquid it will be okay. I've included a photo of the two different bottoms in my review for your reference.", "people_count": 29, "image_usage": 1, "written_date": "December 8, 2022", "product_index": 2}, {"title": "Pot set", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "customer_id": "Pamela A.
