[[{"title": "Worth The Price-Point; Pros and Cons", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "customer_id": "Momo", "body": "So this is actually a review including 2 bottles, as I recently bought one to replace the first one I had (first pic/blue-pink bottle) and haven't used the new one (Opal) yet. So functionality review will be based around my experience with my first.For the sake of those looking for a quick answer; I find the product to be worth the price-point. I also believe in getting what you pay for. I had my bottle for around a year (only tossed-out due to my own folly) and it did everything I wanted out of a bottle.Cons:- There was a bit of a weird, chemically smell/taste like others have mentioned. I did get it to go away; cannot say if others could as well.- You run a small-risk of getting a pre-dented bottle? Amazon makes it pretty easy to exchange (for me).-A little difficult to get the gasket in and out, so you can really make sure you don't have any bacteria growth in your lid.- Supposedly \"not actually vacuum-insulated\". **This is based on responses within other comments.Pros:- Absolutely keeps your drinks cold. Even if you just put the drink in cold, with no additonal ice.- At least sturdy enough to only get a little scuffed-up when it falls to the asphalt from the top of your car and no safety-bands on it.- Good for a long time, as long you don't heck up and let it get gross by accident. And you may even just be more confident in your sanitizing abilities than I am.As I mentioned above; I got my first bottle (blue/pink) about a year ago. I only replaced it because of my own mess-up, where I left Liquid IV I was drinking-on in it for waayy too long (I am ADHD and object permanency/executive dysfunction is a constant struggle) and I was not going to try and believe I could clean it thoroughly enouch, especially since the bacteria had gotten under the gasket as well (the thin, opaque, silicone-ring in your lid that creates the seal. The ring is removable (need something to pry it out), however that's a tight spot and didn't think I could scrub into it enough and feel safe.I don't believe my first bottle came with the additional 2-lids, so that was a nice surprise this-time-around, to have some options.I won't even really touch on the \"is it actually vacuum-insulated or not\" convo because, as much as I have a vague-knowledge about vacuum-spaces and the science to that.. I have the ability to admit I know nothing about how that applies to water-bottles enough to make some of the statements others have in their reviews. The Company seems adamant in that they are.. and if they have a step within their manufacturing process that involves attempting to create some kind of a vacuum-layer? Then I'm not going to sit here and try to call them liars, just because it doesn't seem to fit an ideal of what that should look like. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDoes it keep your stuff cold?? Yeah, 100%. I have put just refrigerated water, with no ice, and it's stayed cold for hours. Then it's even colder/longer with ice. I did get the weird, chemically smell/taste that others have mentioned. But I just used a straw-cleaning brush to get into the drinking-nozzle and crevices of the lid with some Dawn and really hot water and it was gone.There were a few, good drops that had happened and it barely dented, really even barely scuffed, which was impressive.. until.. lolWe come to the original order of the replacement bottle (Opal). Now, I was able to immediately order a replacement (that is 100% fine) and am sending this one back.. however, I am just incredibly curious what in the WORLD happened to it, more than anything?? Lol My old-bottle had never exactly fallen at 50mph onto a curb or anything like that.... But if the bottle in the 2nd pic is any indication to the possible results, I don't recommend being that rough with it. Lol the Amazon bag did not have any damage that correlated to the damage on the box/bottle, so I'm assuming it had already happened before being packaged for shipping to me. With how hard Amazon employees work, I don't really blame them for missing it (or not caring if they did see it lol).If you're looking for a water-bottle that functions and you don't mind the possibility of needing to exchange a faulty one and giving it a GOOD scrub before-use (really should be, anyways)? This is a great choice at a more humble price-point, compared to other brands whose products don't function much, if any better than this one would for you.", "people_count": 79, "image_usage": 1, "written_date": "February 5, 2023", "product_index": 4}, {"title": "Top Notch!", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "customer_id": "Christopher Inman", "body": "I have been suing my 32oz Iron Flask for well over a year.

Starr", "body": "I have been using a couple of Contigo water bottles for the past few years (a 24 oz. and 32 oz. Ashland Autospout), and I really liked them. However, they are not insulated, so will collect condensation on them when filled with ice water. I decided to get the Iron Flask because I know somebody who has one and likes it. I purchased the 40 oz. black bottle.I can fill this bottle with ice and cover the ice in water, and the ice will still be there 8-9 hours later, but only if you're not drinking out of it (I left ice water in it over night just as a test). If you are drinking from it occasionally, the ice is more likely to melt a little faster. Condensation has never formed on the outside of the bottle. The wide mouth is pretty much par-for-the-course for metal bottles; my Contigo tops actually fit well on this bottle. My MSR MiniWorks EX is a little more of a snug fit, but it still fits enough that I feel confident that I could use the two in concert to procure water outdoors. I have also purchased the Iron Flask paracord handle, which makes the bottle easier to carry. I do see some room for improvement, though not with the bottle itself, which has been working out great so far. My complaints are mostly with the straw/spout lid (which is the only one I use), and most of those I only really have because I am comparing it to my Contigo lids.The old Contigo Autospout lids were better in almost every respect; they had a lower profile, they were more watertight, they had a more rigid straw, and you could operate them with one hand. The Iron Flask lid often has to be set on a surface to be opened with one hand. Having a springy spout with a button-operated catch is a much easier and more convenient system to use one-handed. The loop on the spout lid is also just about perpendicular to the long axis of the bottle, which makes carrying it in hand or attaching it to a backpack a little more cumbersome than a design with an more steeply angled loop. As mentioned above, I purchased the paracord handle, and that makes this bottle significantly more convenient. The air inlet on the lid is plugged by a small post that is molded into the drinking spout. This is enough to keep water from pouring out when the spout is closed, but if the bottle is laid on its side, there will be some minor seeping over time. Something like an umbrella valve might make this problem go away. The last problem I have is the straw is not quite as rigidly fixed to the top as I'd like. If you fill up the bottle with ice, it is harder to jam the straw all the way to the bottom because it is held to the lid with a flexible fitting (looks like silicone, maybe). The Contigo straw was less likely to wobble around as you pushed it through the ice, which meant it was easier to put on when the bottle was filled with ice.All in all, I'd say the bottle is very good, but the tops are a little lacking. I would simply use the tops to my old Contigo bottles if they had longer straws that went all the way to the bottom of the bottle, but they don't. Iron Flask should seriously consider creating something similar to the old Autospout lids (or even just licensing the design or something). Even if they sold it separately, I think it would be an excellent addition to a very good bottle.", "people_count": 93, "image_usage": 0, "written_date": "November 8, 2022", "product_index": 4}], [{"title": "Great Flasks!", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "customer_id": "Emily", "body": "These are by far my favorite water bottles.

I bought it while pregnant because I knew I‚Äôd need an easy way to drink tons of water while breastfeeding and caring for a new baby. Boy was I right! Used it in labor/delivery, all day especially those first few weeks when it was hard to get up and down to get a cup of water, all night when baby woke up to nurse and triggered me to be thirsty, and it was the first water bottle the baby learned to drink from when old enough for water. We always have it on us when we leave the house. We farm and garden and have used it daily on farm trips and it holds up to getting dropped, extreme heat, bitter cold, dirt, sand, cow poop, you name it. The colored powder coating and the rest of the water bottle still looks fantastic.Eventually the straw lid, that I love so much because it allows me to drink a lot of water quickly, started having suction issues, leaking, and eventually the mouthpiece became loose from me fiddling with it trying to get it to work and from cleaning and the kid lost it somewhere after that. Switched to the canteen style lid and didn‚Äôt like it.I decided to reach out to Iron Flask to see if they would replace the straw lid and they were super fast to respond to my email and sent me not one, but TWO replacement straw lids (for free). It came with 2 of the actual lids, 4 straws, and 2 straw cleaning brushes! Retail packaging and everything. Very impressive customer service.My only regret with this water bottle was not buying a second one in 40oz and having that one for daytime and the 32oz one that stays clean by the bedside for night time so if I‚Äôm tired and the daytime one is dirty I don‚Äôt take a dirt covered water bottle into the bedroom.

I was looking for something made of metal or different from plastic because I hate the smell of plastic bottles after washing and washing really hard. The only two things that I don't like about this bottle it's that the lid is made of plastic, so of course it's gonna smell if you drink coffee or put some protein in your bottle, and also it the fact that is too thin is also bad because that makes it harder to clean deep your bottle.

I've used this water bottle every day (literally) for a little over a year and it still looks and works as if it's brand new. The color hasn't faded and it hasn't dented- and I haven't exactly been gentle with it. The lids and plastic straws haven't been compromised even though I run them in the dishwasher to sanitize them. I mostly use the straw lid, but it's nice having the extra lids to use when washing the straw lid. I was worried that lugging around a half gallon by the handle would eventually strip the plastic screw pattern of the lid or break the handle, but they're still going strong. This bottle will probably last a lifetime unless I toss it off a mountain or something. I love the color choices. I'm tempted to buy a few others just for the colors even though I really don't need them. I definitely recommend Iron Flask, especially if you're an outdoorsy type. I fill mine up with ice and water and it will stay cold for many hours even when left in a hot car. These bottles would make great gifts too.
