Only thing missing in the Nongshim Shin is the bone broth powder concentrate that's included with Black Shin. In my opinion that's the only thing which makes the Black Shin better (and more expensive).Now here's the trick to save money and create a ramen even better than Black Shin. Next time you buy this ramen also purchase \"Japanese Noodles Tonkotsu Ramen Concentration Pork Bone Soup\". Use approx. half a pack of the pork bone soup concentrate (save the other half for later use), noodles, dried vegetables and spicy powder. This not only takes your ramen game to the next level it also allows you to adjust the spiciness without losing flavor.

They’re incredibly easy to prepare, and easy to make into a fancier meal by adding vegetables, meat, and other toppings. There are two main ways that I usually prepare these. One is my “lazy” method and the other is still easy but a tiny bit more time consuming.1. Lazy method: Use a bowl big enough to fit the noodles with around two inches to spare. Pour the spice mix on top, and pour boiling water into your bowl. Cover with a lid immediately and let sit for around 5 minutes. Stir and enjoy!2. Less lazy method: Bring a small sauce pot to a boil on the stove and add the noodles and spices. Cook for around 3-5 minutes depending on your texture preference. Stir a few times and make sure to separate the noodles so they cook evenly.For both these methods, I’d recommend adding leafy vegetables (spinach, Napa cabbage), poached egg (you can crack a raw egg directly into your pot about two minutes before the noodles are done in method 2), and possibly some meat (pork belly, rotisserie chicken, spam, anything else you have lying around). If you’re feeling extra adventurous, top it with a slice of American cheese! It sounds weird, but it’s delicious!The only warning that I’d give is that the spicy powder can get quite spicy.

The noodles are great. Just the right amount of toothy texture and springiness. To make these \"American\" version noodles a bit spicier I add a little Gochujang Hot. Also the vegetables are dried differently. Try soaking for about 5-10 minutes in a small bowl of boiled water. I also squirt a small amount of sesame oil in the bottom of my noodle bowl and sprinkle my spice pack over the oil and shake the bowl to even it out over the bottom. drain and add veggies, then noodles, add boiling water , cover bowl for no more than 3 minutes. stir with chopsticks and eat while hot or noodles will get soggy.FOR SUPPER NOODLES - prepare pork beef or chicken meat just before noodles and cut into strips. In a separate bowl add meat chopped onion and Gochujang, ad to bowl and stir after the 3 min wait right before eating. I also sometimes add a fried or soft boiled egg making sure yolk is liquid to mix into broth, but add the egg before the meat. do not stir the meat with the noodles or they WILL get SOGGY! I also add Wei Chuan Chili Bamboo Shoots from a jar, which I have not found on Amazon yet. I usually get a few jars at a time from Asian market when I go. For the chicken skinless boneless thigh meat works best. For pork boneless country style ribs work best. For beef have top cab sirloin cut thick about 2 inches and cut into sections to marinade for about 5 days freeze what you are not using after marinating. Roast chicken or pork in preheated oven seasoned as you like at high temp (400-450 F) for about 20-38 min, turning half way through. The beef you can sear in a wok or skillet and leave rare but slice very thin. slice the meat up add the Gochujang, and onions a little Mirin a small cap full of rice vinegar, and the chopped onion. Mix well add to noodles right as you are ready to eat, and press down with chopsticks to mix the juices. To mix well push the meat down rapidly with chopsticks a few times. The meat is the last thing to go on, except stuff like bean sprouts and bamboo shoots.
