Even after they loose pressure they still bounce better than n the balls made from 2 halves, and most definitely these balls, which are pressurized, but quickly loose pressure after the halves start to detach. Another thing i take issues with, is that these ‚Äúpressurized bells come in a box, so they are not fully pressurized when they are received. Pressurized tennis balls should be stored in a container which is designed to maintain the pressure of the balls . Like the container which holds 3 at a time, the balls are not subject to pressure change until the pressure in the container, becomes less than that inside each of the balls.

I planned to drill, or poke, a small hole in each ball, inject some Great Stuff expanding foam, then jam the ball over the protruding nut (into the hole that I made), and when the injected foam hardens, it should form around the bolt threads and hold the balls onto the bolts pretty well, yet I could still remove the balls easily enough if necessary later on.
