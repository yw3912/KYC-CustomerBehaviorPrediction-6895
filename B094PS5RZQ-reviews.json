As for general use it is more useable, but not using the scroll wheel makes every website and general workflow a hassle.If you want to take the risk with buying one of these then good luck I am 0 for 2 on these.

Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better.

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

I don't know why I thought it would be different than any of the other Razor products I've owned. Razor is absolute trash marketed towards the gaming community. They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by \"pro gamers\" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later.",

The fatal flaw though is the mouse wheel, it squeaks extremely loudly with any movement and its like nails on a caulk board.

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by \"pro gamers\" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later.",

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by \"pro gamers\" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better.

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

I don't know why I thought it would be different than any of the other Razor products I've owned. Razor is absolute trash marketed towards the gaming community. They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by \"pro gamers\" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later.",

I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program).

As for general use it is more useable, but not using the scroll wheel makes every website and general workflow a hassle.If you want to take the risk with buying one of these then good luck I am 0 for 2 on these.

Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better.

I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later.",

Overall feel and control of the mouse is fine basically what youd expect for a gaming mouse. The fatal flaw though is the mouse wheel, it squeaks extremely loudly with any movement and its like nails on a caulk board. Seems like proper clearance wasnt given between the wheel and the track it sits in but ive tried to ignore it for almost a week hoping it would break it and wear down or loosen up but sadly it has not and im honestly about to switch back to my old mouse and just order another like it.",

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

I don't know why I thought it would be different than any of the other Razor products I've owned. Razor is absolute trash marketed towards the gaming community. They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by \"pro gamers\" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later.",

The fatal flaw though is the mouse wheel, it squeaks extremely loudly with any movement and its like nails on a caulk board.

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better.

The fatal flaw though is the mouse wheel, it squeaks extremely loudly with any movement and its like nails on a caulk board.

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",
