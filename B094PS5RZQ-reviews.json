The fatal flaw though is the mouse wheel, it squeaks extremely loudly with any movement and its like nails on a caulk board.

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",
