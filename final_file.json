      "body": "I wanted to title this \"First usage of a high-end mouse\", but at this price, it isn't really high-end, but it is a step up from the cheaper mice, and I wanted to see what it was like.I am impressed (mostly).It is a heavier mouse, but that makes it feel more solid, and I like that a lot. I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

The only complaint I have is that when I use scroll up and down (I use a lot in gaming) it mistakes it as scroll press way too easily, my old mouse wasn’t like that. If I scroll up just a little too much it will activate the scroll press in my games (which is usually ping) and it’s annoying. Other than that the mouse is pretty looking",

Also, it is super light. I like that it's not heavy, but I'd like a little more \"feel\" to it when I go to hold/engage it. This is obviously all personal preference.",

      "body": "I needed a high quality laser mouse. I play FPS games. Not \"professionally\" and I don't even intend to try. I imagine there is a need for very advanced mice. So if that is you, maybe check reviews by people who intend to game+stream for a living to ensure you are getting the really in-depth look and the best information. If you need durable laser mouse and enjoy games, and are trying to find that sweet spot between buying quality and not breaking the bank, I think this is your mouse. I probably got it on sale, but my Logitech M500s broke a second time (RIP good buddy) I decided I would just try a new mouse. That Logitech was basically everything I needed and wanted in a mouse but I figure Razer made nice stuff and I wanted to try a simple corded mouse with a few extra buttons. This was everything I needed and more. It has 1) a light on it and 2) some software to install. I didn't really want to but I installed it. I think you have to register. I did. It wasn't a pain but it's a mouse. You should plug it in and use it and that's it. The bad thing is the light. It's a green light and bright. That's completely unnecessary. You can easily turn it off with the software you install and I did. Beyond that, I have everything I need. It feels great in the hand. The additional buttons are in sensible places and that helps with games. The scroll-wheel is just fine. Great mouse! Turn the light off and it is even better.",

      "body": "1. This mouse is not \"lightweight junk\".2. Braided cables are worse.3. Silicone side grips were never that great.Some of the reviews on here are ridiculous. Let me clear some things up.The Kailh switches in here are mid-weight and feel slightly heavier (and less mushy) than the optical switches in the Deathadder V2. The side buttons feel significantly better than the V2. The scroll wheel is less tactile (or smoother, depending on how you look at it).This is a heavy, heavy boy by today's standards. This thing is better built than the V2, but consequently harder to do a weight reduction mod because the plastic is so damn thick.People that complain about this version not having a braided cable... you want an even less flexible one?! Razer's braided cable is the same rubber cable with an additional outside sheath, making it even less flexible. This cable is an improvement from years past, but it's not great. Fortunately because it's not braided, it's easy to rip the rubber sheath and shielding off, and paracord it.The side grips are meh. It's a bit more than molded plastic, but not as noticeable as the silicone on the V2. Silicone still gets slippery when wet, so best solution was always aftermarket grips. If the V2 had G703 quality rubber grips to being with, then I could see the grip complaints on here being justified.My biggest problem with this thing is the lack of replacement skates. No corepads or tiger ice for this model. It has the rear skate of the V2, but two front skates more similar to the V2 Pro. If you you like the white color or mechanical switches, and use less than 6400dpi, then can't go wrong for $20 and some elbow grease.Software still blows. Can use open source software to permaset light effects when not plugged into PC w/ Synapse.",

I went to the razer forum and a proposed solution was to blow some air to remove dust, if any. I don't have compressed air, so I just blow some air with my mouth, and it fixed the issue. So 4 stars, the mouse is good. I just hope razer would be more cautious with dust infiltration, but after all that's a budget mouse in their catalog... can't ask too much.",

Clearly from the software, it is not defective, it is just unrecognized. I did some online searches only to find this is a very common problem with this mouse - button 4 does not work. The suggestions were the usual, unplug and replug - to no avail. Tried on a different machine, still not recognized.If you do not need that particular button, treat this as a 5/5 review. If you do, there really seems to be no guarantee you can make that button work. Caveat: this is on a high-end Windows gaming PC - your mileage may vary on some other platform.",

I plop them all in a basket and my pup picks them all out and brings them to the closest human for a riveting game of indoor fetch. I have these set on a six-month recurring delivery so by the time I am down to only a ball or two, which seems perfect for our needs.

At the least, they have lasted about 45 minutes. My dog does not chew on them,, he is not one of the dogs who’s goal is to destroy them! The only thing he does besides fetch them, is bite down on them repeatedly as if he were trying to make it squeak. The only time he does this is while he is being the ball back after after i throw it. I am no idea why these balls are pressurized they shouldn’t be because they’re 2/2 they’re made from chew rubber halves, that aren’t even still together very well. If they were still together very well my 36 pound border collie would not be able to bite down on them. He was done over and over while bring in the bathroom looks like he’s kind of chewing gum are trying to squeak them. I swear yesterday one of these balls just slash and 2/2 just covered by the felt after only 6 throws. I have no idea what they’d be like for tennis but I have a feeling they do the same thing! I buy tennis balls, because my dog prefers them, so much that he won’t play with another type of ball!! I try ( i am buying real ones ) to buy real, pressurized, tennis balls, instead of the ones that they specifically make for dogs.I do so because, they are not made if 2 halves glued together (which always eventually come apart) , and because the pressurized ball bounce incredibly well . Even after they loose pressure they still bounce better than n the balls made from 2 halves, and most definitely these balls, which are pressurized, but quickly loose pressure after the halves start to detach. Another thing i take issues with, is that these “pressurized bells come in a box, so they are not fully pressurized when they are received. Pressurized tennis balls should be stored in a container which is designed to maintain the pressure of the balls . Like the container which holds 3 at a time, the balls are not subject to pressure change until the pressure in the container, becomes less than that inside each of the balls. I would gave given 2 stars , if not for this hypocrisy.",

The bolts had an off thread that I could not find acorn nuts for, so I thought about foam balls, tennis balls, etc. I settled on these because they are not 'serious' tennis balls, not really being intended for actual play (they are advertised for 'training'), but because the price was fairly low, they are bright yellow, and they are the correct size for my application. I planned to drill, or poke, a small hole in each ball, inject some Great Stuff expanding foam, then jam the ball over the protruding nut (into the hole that I made), and when the injected foam hardens, it should form around the bolt threads and hold the balls onto the bolts pretty well, yet I could still remove the balls easily enough if necessary later on. The high visibility yellow would warn people, and the large soft balls would not cause injury.I have seen some other people's reviews that these balls were not very durable when used as toys for their dogs, and I cannot comment on that. However I did notice that these balls have a visible raised seam under the fuzzy coating, probably due to sloppy molding of the rubber sphere underneath. So, I would agree with others that these are not the highest quality tennis balls. Still, good enough for my odd application.",

      "body": "I've been replacing a lot of worn out cookware in the last year and I specifically needed one and two quart saucepans and it was very difficult to find them. Apparently those are not common sizes and even looking for them in open stock was not resulting in anything I liked. I am very pleased with these as they are kind of a universal basic black simple design. I measured their content capacity because some of the other reviewers thought they may not be as big as they claim to be but they are. The nonstick seems quite solid. The handles are very sturdy and they are heat safe so that you will be able to put your hand on them without using a hot pad which is important to me; I dislike sauce pans that have metal handles that require you to get out a hot pad every time cuz I always forget. One thing someone commented about was that the handle is heavy enough that the one quart saucepan over balances on the stove and that is true but it has been true of every one quart saucepan I've ever had because if the handle is sturdy it's just going to be that heavy. Now if you have an induction cook surface I believe there may be a problem with the two quart. The one quart seems to have a solid bottom but the two quart has little metal circle inserts, and if the structure is what I think it is, only those little circles will be triggered by the induction cooktop. That means if you're trying to saute something in it, only those exact spots will get hot though if you are warming a liquid it will be okay. I've included a photo of the two different bottoms in my review for your reference.",

The Bluetooth connectivity feature allows me to sync my data to the Etekcity app, making it easy to track my progress and set goals. The app is user-friendly and provides detailed insights into my body composition, including muscle mass and BMI.Slim and Sleek Design: The scale is well-constructed and can support up to 400lb. Its slim and sleek design makes it easy to store in my bathroom and its automatic on/off feature helps save battery life.Strongly Recommended: Overall, I would highly recommend the Etekcity Smart Scale to anyone who wants to track their body composition and monitor their progress over time. It's an excellent product that is accurate, easy to use, and packed with features.The Bads:Inaccurate on Soft Surfaces: It should definitely be used on a hard surface, as even our very low-pile carpeting altered the results.Careful Placement: When you step on the scale, don't step on the edge instead of on the metal contact points or the scale will flip up on you.Connectivity Issues: Once it was connected, it is easy to use and keep track of the results, but connecting with my smartphone was not that straightforward, and I had to read the instructions carefully. I would make sure that you have Bluetooth turned on before you get on the scale so you can have it record your results.",

I also love the features on this scale, I haven't used all the features yet but only had the scale a few days. My husband passed away a couple of months ago and I haven't been eating much. I decided I needed to check my weight as I can't afford to lose weight. My scales weren't giving me a good reading, kept fluctuating. So got this scale. Easy to set up and pair with my cellphone. So much information with the reading. I make sure to weigh myself at the same time every morning. I highly recommend this scale. You can set it for multiple users so the family can keep track of their individual weights. It's very accurate, and easy to read the results.",

I contacted support through the app and told them the steps I’d taken. They replied within 12 hours with a worthless answer telling me to do all the things I had already told them I had done.Then I figured it out. We have had a cold snap this week and the bathroom has been in the mid 50’s in the mornings. The sensors won’t read when that cold. The scale continued to work fine later in the day but not first thing. If I stand on the scale and warm up the sensors for a minute or two then step off and reweigh myself it will take all readings. My feet, fresh from an electric blanket cocoon, are warm enough to heat the sensors.Crazy but true.",

I haven’t checked out all the awesome phone connection pluses it has yet.Just giving pointers for weighing yourself on a scale1-Go to CVS or Walgreens or the doctors office to get weighed. Then go home and weigh yourself. This way, you know your weight is correct.2- When you wake up in the morning, go to the bathroom first, then weigh yourself before you drink or eat.3- NEVER weigh yourself throughout the day!!!! You will gain weight within the day that you will lose by morning (water weight)Some people weigh in daily and some weekly. Choose what is best for you. I personally prefer to weigh in daily. This way can check myself if I see it going in the wrong direction.Good luck",

It's not just a regular bathroom scale - it's a complete body composition monitor that gives me accurate readings of my weight, body fat, muscle mass, and BMI. The Bluetooth connectivity makes it super easy to track my progress and see how my body is changing over time.What I love most about this scale is the accuracy - it measures weight to the nearest 0.05lb and body fat to the nearest 0.02kg. This level of precision is truly amazing and gives me the confidence to know that I'm getting accurate readings.The scale is also very easy to use - simply step on and it gives you a quick and accurate reading. The display is large and easy to read, and the readings are very consistent. I also appreciate the fact that it has a weight capacity of up to 400lb, so it can accommodate people of all sizes.Overall, I would highly recommend the Etekcity Smart Scale to anyone who wants to track their body composition and monitor their progress over time. It's an excellent product that is accurate, easy to use, and packed with features. I give it a 5-star rating and would definitely recommend it in the future!",

Wearing the same attire, the difference was about 2/10 of a pound - can't ask for much better than that.

Even within the app you clicking on the subcategories such as your BMR, Metabolic Age, as well as many more useful things such as water weight, muscle mass, even how much protein is stored in your body at the moment. If you're really wanting to get into tracking your body and how it works i'd recommend getting this scale as well as seeing a dietitian, both of these together will put you up for success!!!!",

      "body": "Initially, I was excited to use this scale because of the added measurements but it turns out, those measurements are not accurate. The measurement that is accurate is the mass itself (your body weight and BMI). The water measurement, visceral fat, muscle, protein, etc are all BS. If you want a real assessment of your metrics, go with another scale. These metrics are based on collected data received from people in a similar weight category. SMH.Example: I measured myself Day 1 and it happened to be during the end of my time of month. I weighed in at 181 pounds. BMI 30.5. Visceral fat 13. Body fat 36.1. Muscle mass 109.2.On Day 2: Weight 178.4 pounds. BMI 29.7. Body fat 35.2. Visceral fat 12. Muscle mass 108.6.On Day 3: weight 177.0 pounds. BMI 29.5. Body fat 34.9%. Visceral fat 12. Muscle mass 108.3.Skip to day 11: weight 176.5 pounds. BMI 29.4. Body fat 34.7%. Visceral fat 12. Muscle mass 108.4.Today Day 13: weight 179.7 pounds. BMI 29.9. Body fat 35.5%. Visceral fat 12. Muscle mass 109.1.For reference: my body measurements are: day 1: Bust- 38.5” DDWaist: 31”Hips: 46”Reference 2: I put on 20 pounds in the last two years. My normal measurements are Bust 34” DD, waist 26”, hips 42”Reference 3: day 13 body measurements: Bust 40” DD, waist 33”, hips 46” (measurements have gone up because I turn into a bloated lolly pop during PMS time) plus I have more muscle on my abs. Sidenote: your waist will grow slightly thicker when building muscle UNTIL you get off the extra fat and focus on cardio. I shared these measurements so that you can see, hopefully, the correlation between the scale measurements for day 13. My body expanded from water wait and it’s why the scale read a higher mass. The discrepancy lies in the body fat- I did not gain body fat in the last two weeks but the scale is saying otherwise because again, it is an average reading of people in a similar age, gender, and body weight! Look at day 11 and 13. The measurements tell me my body fat increased. This is inaccurate for two reasons: 1) I’ve increased my physical activity while I’ve cut calories and 2) I have gained water weight since it’s coming close to my cycle (NOT FAT).Now, compare my Day 1 measurements to Day 13. I call BS on this scale because my muscle mass did not go down and then suddenly back up to where it was 2 weeks prior. The difference is my diet! I’ve fluctuated between high and low carbs every few days. That’s the only difference and I’m still working out regularly. Secondly, my goal is to lose body fat and I’ve been in the gym focusing on weights to build muscle. My diet has been CLEAN and in a caloric deficit with one cheat meal a week. I eat Plantbased and have also cut sugar out and processed foods almost completely. I don’t eat processed food daily and I’ve been focusing on a large quantity of veggies and fresh fruit with each meal and snack. Also, I know for a fact I’ve gained muscle mass ( beyond what this scale is saying) because my thighs are noticeably thicker and I have more muscle on my upper arms ( triceps, deltoids, traps). Thirdly, notice how the measurements increase with an increase in body mass and how they decrease with a decrease in body mass.So again, I call BS. If you want real measurements, not just something to make you feel good and tingly inside, find another scale. If you’re only going for your body mass, this is a good scale.Just FYI- some of the days I am eating low carbs which will cause the scale to drop drastically. On the days I eat high carbs ( bread, rice), the scale is higher the very next morning. Why? Carbohydrates bond to water molecules which cause an increase in water!If I am wrong, I will come back and update this post. I will still update periodically. Hope this helps.",

      "body": "So this is actually a review including 2 bottles, as I recently bought one to replace the first one I had (first pic/blue-pink bottle) and haven't used the new one (Opal) yet. So functionality review will be based around my experience with my first.For the sake of those looking for a quick answer; I find the product to be worth the price-point. I also believe in getting what you pay for. I had my bottle for around a year (only tossed-out due to my own folly) and it did everything I wanted out of a bottle.Cons:- There was a bit of a weird, chemically smell/taste like others have mentioned. I did get it to go away; cannot say if others could as well.- You run a small-risk of getting a pre-dented bottle? Amazon makes it pretty easy to exchange (for me).-A little difficult to get the gasket in and out, so you can really make sure you don't have any bacteria growth in your lid.- Supposedly \"not actually vacuum-insulated\". **This is based on responses within other comments.Pros:- Absolutely keeps your drinks cold. Even if you just put the drink in cold, with no additonal ice.- At least sturdy enough to only get a little scuffed-up when it falls to the asphalt from the top of your car and no safety-bands on it.- Good for a long time, as long you don't heck up and let it get gross by accident. And you may even just be more confident in your sanitizing abilities than I am.As I mentioned above; I got my first bottle (blue/pink) about a year ago. I only replaced it because of my own mess-up, where I left Liquid IV I was drinking-on in it for waayy too long (I am ADHD and object permanency/executive dysfunction is a constant struggle) and I was not going to try and believe I could clean it thoroughly enouch, especially since the bacteria had gotten under the gasket as well (the thin, opaque, silicone-ring in your lid that creates the seal. The ring is removable (need something to pry it out), however that's a tight spot and didn't think I could scrub into it enough and feel safe.I don't believe my first bottle came with the additional 2-lids, so that was a nice surprise this-time-around, to have some options.I won't even really touch on the \"is it actually vacuum-insulated or not\" convo because, as much as I have a vague-knowledge about vacuum-spaces and the science to that.. I have the ability to admit I know nothing about how that applies to water-bottles enough to make some of the statements others have in their reviews. The Company seems adamant in that they are.. and if they have a step within their manufacturing process that involves attempting to create some kind of a vacuum-layer? Then I'm not going to sit here and try to call them liars, just because it doesn't seem to fit an ideal of what that should look like. 🤷🏼‍♀️Does it keep your stuff cold?? Yeah, 100%. I have put just refrigerated water, with no ice, and it's stayed cold for hours. Then it's even colder/longer with ice. I did get the weird, chemically smell/taste that others have mentioned. But I just used a straw-cleaning brush to get into the drinking-nozzle and crevices of the lid with some Dawn and really hot water and it was gone.There were a few, good drops that had happened and it barely dented, really even barely scuffed, which was impressive.. until.. lolWe come to the original order of the replacement bottle (Opal). Now, I was able to immediately order a replacement (that is 100% fine) and am sending this one back.. however, I am just incredibly curious what in the WORLD happened to it, more than anything?? Lol My old-bottle had never exactly fallen at 50mph onto a curb or anything like that.... But if the bottle in the 2nd pic is any indication to the possible results, I don't recommend being that rough with it. Lol the Amazon bag did not have any damage that correlated to the damage on the box/bottle, so I'm assuming it had already happened before being packaged for shipping to me. With how hard Amazon employees work, I don't really blame them for missing it (or not caring if they did see it lol).If you're looking for a water-bottle that functions and you don't mind the possibility of needing to exchange a faulty one and giving it a GOOD scrub before-use (really should be, anyways)? This is a great choice at a more humble price-point, compared to other brands whose products don't function much, if any better than this one would for you.",

      "body": "I have been suing my 32oz Iron Flask for well over a year. I used it EVERY day. Its on my desk at work, on the table at home, next to me in my car. I always keep a cold drink of water by my side in my Iron Flask. I can fill it with ice and water before I leave work friday and Monday morning when I roll into work I dump a little bit of ice out (assuming I dont refill the water along the way), wash and refill. Absolute beast when it comes to keeping ice and cold water.Its been durable as well. The color has a couple scratches to metal from dropping in on the ground. However, no dents. I use the flip open straw top exclusively and it was fine til i dropped it when open and it landed on that. It still works, but is a little wonky now (as in it has to be slightly pulled to the side to seal completely).I have never used it for hot drinks so I honestly dont know how it is for hot stuff, but thats not what I bought it for. I bought it specific for ice water at work. Its way to good to keep it on my desk alone so it travels with me. Zero complaints. Would buy then for family and my self again.",

Bigger than most water bottles without being awkward and enormous. 2. The peach is a beautiful color, I would call it more salmon or coral though than peach, but that’s what I wanted was coral so I’m happy. 3. My previous bottle drove me crazy because it was also metal and so LOUD! The handle is not one that swivels so it can’t hit the side and clang. Also when you drink (with the straw) it’s silent not a slurping noise. I bought the iron flask boot as well so the bottom doesn’t clang when you sit it down either. 4. Yesterday it was close to 80 degrees and it sat outside all day with me and the original ice still in it. It really does keep it cold! I’m not sure about hot because I don’t plan on using it for hot.Only con, which is not really a con, but I added the boot and paracord handle. I wish at least the boot came with it, you really do need it to protect the powder coating and noise reduction.",

Additionally, cleaning the bottle is a breeze, and there's no chance for mold to grow.Lastly, the mint green color is beautiful and gets me lots of compliments wherever I go.

I'm not personally concerned about this, so it isn't a deal breaker for me. I actually like the size of it a lot, I feel like it holds a decent amount of ice and water, and even though I drink from it often I don't have to fill it every time after I take a drink.I think if you're looking for a reliable water bottle, this is a good choice.",

Soda always has a bad flavor from metal thurmice/cups but this one, I can safely say it works.

Insulation is decent, but dont take my word for that one. I am also not a coffee person, so do your research if you are that type of person. 4/5 stars only because cleaning can be a challenge with the lids.Got extra straw and a sticker with my purchase :) I can't be happier realistically.",

      "body": "I have been using a couple of Contigo water bottles for the past few years (a 24 oz. and 32 oz. Ashland Autospout), and I really liked them. However, they are not insulated, so will collect condensation on them when filled with ice water. I decided to get the Iron Flask because I know somebody who has one and likes it. I purchased the 40 oz. black bottle.I can fill this bottle with ice and cover the ice in water, and the ice will still be there 8-9 hours later, but only if you're not drinking out of it (I left ice water in it over night just as a test). If you are drinking from it occasionally, the ice is more likely to melt a little faster. Condensation has never formed on the outside of the bottle. The wide mouth is pretty much par-for-the-course for metal bottles; my Contigo tops actually fit well on this bottle. My MSR MiniWorks EX is a little more of a snug fit, but it still fits enough that I feel confident that I could use the two in concert to procure water outdoors. I have also purchased the Iron Flask paracord handle, which makes the bottle easier to carry. I do see some room for improvement, though not with the bottle itself, which has been working out great so far. My complaints are mostly with the straw/spout lid (which is the only one I use), and most of those I only really have because I am comparing it to my Contigo lids.The old Contigo Autospout lids were better in almost every respect; they had a lower profile, they were more watertight, they had a more rigid straw, and you could operate them with one hand. The Iron Flask lid often has to be set on a surface to be opened with one hand. Having a springy spout with a button-operated catch is a much easier and more convenient system to use one-handed. The loop on the spout lid is also just about perpendicular to the long axis of the bottle, which makes carrying it in hand or attaching it to a backpack a little more cumbersome than a design with an more steeply angled loop. As mentioned above, I purchased the paracord handle, and that makes this bottle significantly more convenient. The air inlet on the lid is plugged by a small post that is molded into the drinking spout. This is enough to keep water from pouring out when the spout is closed, but if the bottle is laid on its side, there will be some minor seeping over time. Something like an umbrella valve might make this problem go away. The last problem I have is the straw is not quite as rigidly fixed to the top as I'd like. If you fill up the bottle with ice, it is harder to jam the straw all the way to the bottom because it is held to the lid with a flexible fitting (looks like silicone, maybe). The Contigo straw was less likely to wobble around as you pushed it through the ice, which meant it was easier to put on when the bottle was filled with ice.All in all, I'd say the bottle is very good, but the tops are a little lacking. I would simply use the tops to my old Contigo bottles if they had longer straws that went all the way to the bottom of the bottle, but they don't. Iron Flask should seriously consider creating something similar to the old Autospout lids (or even just licensing the design or something). Even if they sold it separately, I think it would be an excellent addition to a very good bottle.",

I haven't tried hot beverages in this, but I'm sure it would do a great job at keeping those hot as well. The only issue I've ever had has been cleaning the lid/gaskets thoroughly, as some reviewers have mentioned previously.

No response, so eventually I cancelled the order and went with Iron Flask. I didn't realize it came with a lifetime warranty until I received it.

I regret nothing. If you're on the fence, hop down and buy it.",

Me and my 40oz flask were in a bad crash early 2022 and has not a single scratch or any indication of damage of any sort. I’ve dropped it too many times to count-yes even on concrete and asphalt- and you can not tell at all. I recently got the 22oz simply because the 40oz does not fit cup holders and is more travel friendly. Tops are interchangeable, and comes with 3 lids plus 2 straws each. Also great for self defense if you have the paracord handle! This will forever be my go to! #customerforlife",

I'm used to working with cast iron so I know I can scrub it out but it's not really something I want to have to worry about constantly.Other than that I feel like I haven't really been able to give this a fair shot but as mentioned, I bought a 40 oz as well which I'm hoping will be better.Also, I'm rating this as \"not easy to drink from\" (next section of review asks for a star rating on this feature) because I very much want a super fast, super smooth flow so I can chug like my embrava (not insulated) water bottles but I don't think that I will ever get that from any hot drink lid. Still a pita to have the lids be so... Gluggy and slow pour just because I prefer warm water.",

      "body": "This water bottle has been great in so many ways. I bought it while pregnant because I knew I’d need an easy way to drink tons of water while breastfeeding and caring for a new baby. Boy was I right! Used it in labor/delivery, all day especially those first few weeks when it was hard to get up and down to get a cup of water, all night when baby woke up to nurse and triggered me to be thirsty, and it was the first water bottle the baby learned to drink from when old enough for water. We always have it on us when we leave the house. We farm and garden and have used it daily on farm trips and it holds up to getting dropped, extreme heat, bitter cold, dirt, sand, cow poop, you name it. The colored powder coating and the rest of the water bottle still looks fantastic.Eventually the straw lid, that I love so much because it allows me to drink a lot of water quickly, started having suction issues, leaking, and eventually the mouthpiece became loose from me fiddling with it trying to get it to work and from cleaning and the kid lost it somewhere after that. Switched to the canteen style lid and didn’t like it.I decided to reach out to Iron Flask to see if they would replace the straw lid and they were super fast to respond to my email and sent me not one, but TWO replacement straw lids (for free). It came with 2 of the actual lids, 4 straws, and 2 straw cleaning brushes! Retail packaging and everything. Very impressive customer service.My only regret with this water bottle was not buying a second one in 40oz and having that one for daytime and the 32oz one that stays clean by the bedside for night time so if I’m tired and the daytime one is dirty I don’t take a dirt covered water bottle into the bedroom. Maybe that’ll be my next gift to myself.My husband has the biggest sized one for work and loves it too. So glad to not be buying him packs of water from the store anymore. Not we spend less, drink less micro plastics and fluoride, and have nice cold water on hand in abundance. I’ve noticed his water consumption has gone way up since he got his and he usually drinks the entire thing during his workday.Highly recommend this product and company.",

All things considered pretty good experience overall with the product and iron flask as a company, would recommend.For the bottle itself, it keeps drinks the same temperature they were put in for quite a while, poured hot water in at night when it was too hot to drink comfortably and then next morning it was a pleasant level of hot. From what I noticed the outer part of the bottle doesnt change temperature due to the drink inside.Lids, they all work though personal preference plays a big part in which you like best. Screw on lid is great for keeping drink temperature the same for longer but isnt great for frequent quick sips. Flip top is good but drinking from the bottle may be difficult for people with larger noses or larger bottle sizes due to the weight and since the hole is so recessed in the lid. Straw lid is convenient with ease of use and cleaning (inner section is removable and comes with a spare), solid top section doesnt feel the best since its rectangular shaped but you get used to it",

So far, it seems to be fairly quiet.The colors are also amazing and are pretty true to the pictures on here. Very happy with this purchase.",

The only two things that I don't like about this bottle it's that the lid is made of plastic, so of course it's gonna smell if you drink coffee or put some protein in your bottle, and also it the fact that is too thin is also bad because that makes it harder to clean deep your bottle.

The color hasn't faded and it hasn't dented- and I haven't exactly been gentle with it. The lids and plastic straws haven't been compromised even though I run them in the dishwasher to sanitize them. I mostly use the straw lid, but it's nice having the extra lids to use when washing the straw lid. I was worried that lugging around a half gallon by the handle would eventually strip the plastic screw pattern of the lid or break the handle, but they're still going strong. This bottle will probably last a lifetime unless I toss it off a mountain or something. I love the color choices. I'm tempted to buy a few others just for the colors even though I really don't need them. I definitely recommend Iron Flask, especially if you're an outdoorsy type. I fill mine up with ice and water and it will stay cold for many hours even when left in a hot car. These bottles would make great gifts too. Love it!",

Then lastly, add dried veg pack.Or you can add full spicy seasoning pack, but it is super hot.These ramens are so good and much better quality than cheap ramens in store, like Nissan or Matachan.

So I decided to just cough up the 20$ rather than wait months for it to go back in stock! I'm really glad it came in 2 boxes rather than 1 singular box. I was scared things would leak onto the package or something may have been tampered with due to the reviews. Thankfully my package arrived safe, on time and in good condition!!Ramen Review-This ramen is really good if you like maruchan then you'll like this. It's basically a premium version of maruchan. BUT you do have to season it yourself and maybe add your toppings if you want a little extra. It does come with a spicy sauce packet, dried veggies and of course the noodles. I think it's a really good base, you just have to season it! ^^ and yes all 20 packs were in the box. 😂",

If you haven’t had these before they’re HOT I personally have to add about 1 tbsp of water to the pot so I can tolerate them. That being said I also think jalapeños are HOT so if you like spice they probably won’t hit you as hard. The spice is like a numbing immediate heat and the broth is super flavorful, I will literally eat a whole package (2 servings) myself and drink ALL of the broth even though the spice has me sweating! Highly recommend a glass of milk and even a slice of shokupan or white bread. If you’re looking for something spicy, tasty, and hearty stop looking! As a side note the dehydrated vegetables are BEAUTIFUL nice chunks of mushroom, carrots, peppers and green onions!",

If you get rotisserie chickens, take the meat you want n make stock with remains carrot celery onion black peppercorns bayleaf and garlic cloves, cover with cold water. DO NOT ADD SALT. It takes about 3 hours will be sooner if you break the bones. Strain it 2x through a double fine mesh, chill in fridge, remove fat off the top once cooled, potion the amount you would use for ramen. So remove a frozen potion of NO SALT stock, frozen mushroom tare. Place in pot under medium heat let thaw n come to a low boil. Place is soup packet n veggie packet n mix, add noddles boil for 4 mins (drop in a raw egg for the last 45 sec if you want!!) remember the difference between this and Black is black comes with an anchovy soup base packet and dehydrated shitake mushrooms.",

      "body": "I used to purchase the Black Shin ramen. It's literally the best instant ramen out there as far as I could find. Nongshim Shin ramen is good. Same noodles, dried vegetables, and very similar spicy flavoring as the Black Shin. Only thing missing in the Nongshim Shin is the bone broth powder concentrate that's included with Black Shin. In my opinion that's the only thing which makes the Black Shin better (and more expensive).Now here's the trick to save money and create a ramen even better than Black Shin. Next time you buy this ramen also purchase \"Japanese Noodles Tonkotsu Ramen Concentration Pork Bone Soup\". Use approx. half a pack of the pork bone soup concentrate (save the other half for later use), noodles, dried vegetables and spicy powder. This not only takes your ramen game to the next level it also allows you to adjust the spiciness without losing flavor. And in my opinion it's healhier because the pork bone soup concentrate is 100% natural (water, salt and pork bone).",

      "body": "These have been my favorite instant noodles since I was a kid, and they still hold a sweet spot in my heart! They’re incredibly easy to prepare, and easy to make into a fancier meal by adding vegetables, meat, and other toppings. There are two main ways that I usually prepare these. One is my “lazy” method and the other is still easy but a tiny bit more time consuming.1. Lazy method: Use a bowl big enough to fit the noodles with around two inches to spare. Pour the spice mix on top, and pour boiling water into your bowl. Cover with a lid immediately and let sit for around 5 minutes. Stir and enjoy!2. Less lazy method: Bring a small sauce pot to a boil on the stove and add the noodles and spices. Cook for around 3-5 minutes depending on your texture preference. Stir a few times and make sure to separate the noodles so they cook evenly.For both these methods, I’d recommend adding leafy vegetables (spinach, Napa cabbage), poached egg (you can crack a raw egg directly into your pot about two minutes before the noodles are done in method 2), and possibly some meat (pork belly, rotisserie chicken, spam, anything else you have lying around). If you’re feeling extra adventurous, top it with a slice of American cheese! It sounds weird, but it’s delicious!The only warning that I’d give is that the spicy powder can get quite spicy. I usually only use about half the packet, otherwise I am crying and sniffling the entire time I’m eating my meal. Start off with just a little bit and adjust to your taste!",

      "body": "Good and spicy much better than the cheapo maruchan, and still not expensive. The noodles are great. Just the right amount of toothy texture and springiness. To make these \"American\" version noodles a bit spicier I add a little Gochujang Hot. Also the vegetables are dried differently. Try soaking for about 5-10 minutes in a small bowl of boiled water. I also squirt a small amount of sesame oil in the bottom of my noodle bowl and sprinkle my spice pack over the oil and shake the bowl to even it out over the bottom. drain and add veggies, then noodles, add boiling water , cover bowl for no more than 3 minutes. stir with chopsticks and eat while hot or noodles will get soggy.FOR SUPPER NOODLES - prepare pork beef or chicken meat just before noodles and cut into strips. In a separate bowl add meat chopped onion and Gochujang, ad to bowl and stir after the 3 min wait right before eating. I also sometimes add a fried or soft boiled egg making sure yolk is liquid to mix into broth, but add the egg before the meat. do not stir the meat with the noodles or they WILL get SOGGY! I also add Wei Chuan Chili Bamboo Shoots from a jar, which I have not found on Amazon yet. I usually get a few jars at a time from Asian market when I go. For the chicken skinless boneless thigh meat works best. For pork boneless country style ribs work best. For beef have top cab sirloin cut thick about 2 inches and cut into sections to marinade for about 5 days freeze what you are not using after marinating. Roast chicken or pork in preheated oven seasoned as you like at high temp (400-450 F) for about 20-38 min, turning half way through. The beef you can sear in a wok or skillet and leave rare but slice very thin. slice the meat up add the Gochujang, and onions a little Mirin a small cap full of rice vinegar, and the chopped onion. Mix well add to noodles right as you are ready to eat, and press down with chopsticks to mix the juices. To mix well push the meat down rapidly with chopsticks a few times. The meat is the last thing to go on, except stuff like bean sprouts and bamboo shoots. Nothing makes me feel better like this stuff!!!",

I drop in some dried birds eye chills and pepper flakes on top of that. In other words, if it doesn’t make you cough while it’s cooking… it’s not hot enough ;)What I really like about this ramyun is that it is extremely versatile. Just dump in whatever ingredients you like and then enjoy. The photo I took has a bowl with handful of sliced mushrooms, some avocado slices and an egg I poached during the last three minutes of cooking. I also added some sliced garlic and green onions. If you like shrimp, drop in a few of those for a nice seafood broth variation.And… if hot broth is not your thing, I highly recommend Shin Black.

      "body": "When my son came home from school asking for these pencils, I though he just liked being able to twist up the erasers. In all fairness, that is the feature that excited him the most, but he kept saying they were easy to write with and his hand wasn't as tired after using it. I do my best to get my kids school supplies that they enjoy using because I know how much more I enjoy my own work when I have tools and supplies that work well or I like for whatever reason. So while a pencil choice might sound a bit silly, I see it as a way of encouraging my kids at school.Compared to other pencils, these aren't exactly cheap, so I initially picked up a 2 pack at a local store, hoping my son would get his fascination with the twist eraser out of his system and this would be the end of it. But when I actually used the pencil? Well let's just say it's the first time in my life I've said 'Wow' after writing with a pencil. It's so incredibly smooth! It actually writes smoother than many pens I've used. And it does not break nearly as easily as most other pencils we've used, mechanical or wooden. So off to Amazon I went to purchase more at a better price, because mom wants a few of these pencils now, too.Now, personally, I'm not super jazzed about the twist eraser as the eraser likes to twist itself out while in my purse (not all the way out, but out enough that I have to twist it back in before each use). This is probably because I don't use pencils often so it sits in my purse getting jostled around for quite a while before it gets pulled out. My son does not have this issue with the ones in his backpack, as he uses them every day at school. He also uses the eraser a lot, so having an extra long eraser is not only 'cool', it's practical for him.One could just buy the strong-yet-buttery-smooth lead refills and put them in a cheaper pencil, if you don't have need or desire for the extra eraser. But this pencil is also very comfortable in my hand, lightweight and balanced well, so I haven't bothered to do that personally. Still, it's an option if you prefer a different pencil design.",

I know this may sound stupid for a simple pencil, but bear with me.I originally ordered this because I have Parkinson's and had been using .7mm pencils for years but was having a great deal of problems with the leads breaking when I had a spasm. I decided to try this pencil because it had a .9mm lead and I thought that it just MIGHT help with the lead breaking problem so I ordered one. Well, it worked very well for the breakage problem. I haven't broken a lead since I started using this pencil. However, I have discovered other great benefits. The new retracting eraser smooths the whole erasing thing out nicely and makes eraser longevity and changing much less of a problem. The larger soft rubber grip also makes the pencil a LOT easier to hang on to, especially for those with my condition.One improvement I have learned to make on the grip: The fattest part of the grip, as it comes, is at the top and doesn't add to the ergonomics of holding the pencil much. I have found that if you simply unscrew and remove the bottom of the pencil where the lead comes out, the rubber grip can simply be slipped off, turned around and reinstalled. Now the fat part of the grip is at the bottom and keeps the fingers in a more sure and comfortable position. The way the manufacturer delivers them doesn't make sense in this respect.However, this pencil is a quantum leap in usability over every other pencil I have ever used and I have since thrown out every other pencil in the house and replaced them with this one.Thank you Pentel for making a better product to simplify our lives.",

Some of the cheaper pencils make it hard to put in refills.The lead guide is metal.The lead is darker than typical.And the biggest reason...The eraser is HUGE. Even though my kids have separate erasers, they seem to never grab those, but instead use the erasers on their pencils. That means on many of their pencils, the erasers are worn down. And on many pencils, the eraser must be removed to put in more lead. When the eraser is worn down to the nub, it's really hard to pull it out to add more lead.Another nice thing about this pencil: the lead refills do not go where the eraser goes. So even when the huge eraser is worn all the way, it's still easy to add more lead.",

The long Eraser works well and lasts a long time.The twist-erase mechanism on this model has enough drag to prevent (mostly) the irritating problem of the eraser creeping out while writing, as happens to me with other Pentel Twist Erase Pencils.An annoyance is that the rubber grip has a lot of friction inside my shirt pocket. When I pull it out, the top part of the pencil sometimes pulls off, leaving the end in my pocket. This happens with several models of Pentel cushioned-grip pencils. I decided I like the cushioned grip enough to put up with the minor drawback.",

      "body": "Without a doubt, Pentel Twist-Erase Mechanical Pencils are the ultimate mechanical pencils.Here is what you get: a dozen mechanical pencils with 0.9mm HB refills (equivalent to a number 2 pencil), that always stay sharp and NEVER break, a white polymer eraser that doesn't tear pages, doesn't leave ghost images, and lasts for what seems like an eternity. The silicone grip is comfortable without being too bulky. These pencils are durable and virtually maintenance-free and will last many years if they don't grow legs and walk away. The fact that they are green simply makes me smile!I have used the Pentel Twist-Erase pencils for years. In fact, I have some that are \"ancient\" and still work as well as if I had purchased them yesterday. In earlier years, there weren't color choices, they didn't have a soft grip, and I felt grateful just to find one of these pencils with a 0.9mm refill.Pentel also makes options available if you prefer a 0.5mm lead (which I break very often) and 0.7mm lead (which are okay if that's your preference). Even at 0.9mm, which is considered a bold/wide/broad refill, the refill still maintains an excellent point as if it were just recently sharpened. In fact, I have passed along all my mechanical pencils that have anything except 0.9mm refills because that is the size for me.I can with complete confidence recommend these pencils. In my opinion, there are none better.",

The parts are all plastic, and in just a short time, they stop \"gripping\" the lead so that it slips back up into the pencil when you try to write with them. Also, the Bic pencils come with very fragile lead that snaps in two with just the least pressure, and their erasers are small and not replaceable. These Pentel pencils are a much better quality! They have a metal part that grips the lead...no slippage. The eraser is very long and can be replaced when it is used up, and the lead that comes in the pencil is a good quality...you can actually write with it without breakage. The grip is nice, too...very comfortable. The only thing not to love is the fact that when you use the eraser, you have to hold the twisting section that raises and lowers the eraser or it will twist all the way back into the pencil, and you will find yourself rubbing the paper with the plastic surrounding the eraser. Once you know to hold this part, it's fine.",

I do have to say, the price is great, and when the pencil works it is great. The pencil also has a long twist-eraser so you don't have to be worried about using up the eraser.

      "body": "I first used the Pentel Twist Erase pencil 3 years ago as I was searching for a good mechanical pencil with a refillable eraser. I have not used any other since. I loved it for all the reasons other buyers have mentioned--large/long refillable eraser, rubber grip (not perfect but better than nothing), and interchangeable parts in case something breaks. I was hesitant to purchase this one, the \"Express XP\", since it was not the same item I was used to.The original, if taken apart would be four pieces (apart from led/eraser). This pencil is only three pieces, since the pocket clip (now a more flexible plastic) is one piece with the upper barrel. BTW, the eraser that fitted the original also fits the Express XP.I've seen the original pencils sell for $3.00 apiece, but this set was a dozen for much less. So a cheaper and simpler design, construction, and material.But when it comes to performance, this pencil has a flaw. With every one of these pencils I had, both my wife and I experienced that sometimes the lead would break inside the tip so it would be stuck in the tip. This happened A LOT--if it didn't I wouldn't mention it or feel the need to edit my original review (which was five stars by the way, but the one who uses an item for years is not the same as the one who uses it for a day or two). But when the lead gets stuck, how do you dislodge it? First, unscrew the tip. Now look inside the removed tip and you'll see that there is a piece of lead in there and you should not be able to see through the lead hole. Then you have to take another mechanical pencil of the same width, get the lead to protrude about a centimeter, and then carefully push that lead into the tip from where it normally writes. Eventually the broken lead will fall out. It's possible to do this cumbersome operation without a second pencil, i.e. with the original, but you have to have more lead in the barrel, pull back on the clinging apparatus, push the barrel as if you're going to push out some lead, now hold it so that some lead will begin to fall out, about a centimeter or so, and then continue as mentioned above. If you don't want to fiddle around with this BS--imagine you're on a bus or in a classroom taking a test or following a fast-talking lecturer and all of a sudden the lead gets stuck like this. Don't waste your time. Spend a few dollars extra and get the original.",

These yellow Pentel Twist Erase mechanical pencils have none of the issues I've just discussed. First, the grip is low enough on the barrel that you can actually hold the pencil at the grip and write accurately. Second, you can put at least 10 leads inside the pencil and it doesn't jam. Third, they have an impressively long eraser. I erase compulsively, and I've only been using two of these pencils since I bought them in July (it's a pack of 12), and the erasers are barely any shorter than they were when I took them out of the box.The long and short of it is that these pencils are GREAT.

I'm a huge fan of the higher end Pentel \"Twist Erase\" pencils, so I figured one with red lead and an eraser specifically designed for that lead would be the holy grail of erasable red lead in a mechanical pencil. But, the biggest disappointment is that \"red pencils\" didn't mean red pencils in the traditional sense ... It meant \"pencils that are red\". My bad. Now I have twelve black-lead pencils that I don't need, and I'm back to searching for good quality mechanical pencils with erasable red lead. Oops.",

I generally liked pencils (over the mechanical) because they felt sturdier in the hand, and the tips were generally tougher. I tend to write a little hard, so at 0.9mm, it's a much more natural write, for me at least.Previously, I had the original Twist Erase pencils (not EXPRESS) and these feel a little cheaper in construction, but otherwise write just as well. The wider body also feels much more natural.Most importantly, the eraser on Twist-Erase pencils are second to none. They're around 3-4 times larger than the average eraser, and will last you at least a solid 6 months per pencil, if you do a lot of erasing that is. You can also buy erasers independently to feed your pencils. Surprisingly, they aren't cheap either, and sometimes find better deals buying just a new pencil/eraser pair then buying just erasers.",

      "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
      "customer_id": "developer1",
      "body": "This is a first impression, as I learn more, I'll add info.I chose this calculator because I needed more memories/variables for storing often-used constants for chemistry courses. It gives you the following memory/variables for quick recall/use: A,B,C,D,E,F,X,Y,M, looks like 9 memories. There are also 40 built-in scientific constants which are less easy to retrieve (shift,const then 01, 02, etc.) but might be handy (of course you can save selected ones in the memory/variables for easier access).Visibility is always an issue with calculators, both keypad glare and screen angle. Compared to a very basic TI-30Xa calculator, the Casio screen is less readable because the digits are smaller and much less contrast (blue on bluish screen vs black on white/gray for TI). As with most reflective LCD screens, including the TI, you have to get the light angle just right for maximum viewing. This is a significant problem I find because lighting varies a lot in different places. Under exam pressure, you can't afford to misread, but it can happen too easily with these screens. But the TI is easier to read - however, it is just a one-number at a time display. The Casio shows your whole formula as you type it, so for that feature you pay a price with less clarity. With the Casio, if I get the light angle best for the display, I tend to get glare on the buttons. The TI has the same issue, but the buttons are bigger and bolder and black/white, so more readable.I chose the white model Casio to see if somehow it is clearer. The numeric pad is white on gray buttons, which is pretty, but not as readable as white on black for sure. I may get the black model to see if that is clearer (actually not sure a black model is available for this exact version).My eyesight is not perfect, so this may be a non-issue for you, especially young people. I just find that the number of hours spent calculating and reading small text is a factor, so I'm trying to optimize eye strain to a minimum and evaluate study tools in that context.Otherwise, I think this Casio fx-115ES Plus is packed with a ton of powerful features and is a great value from that standpoint.Update 9/9/2022 - a feature I miss on this calculator is the \"change sign\" button, which flips the result from positive to negative or vice-versa. You can multiply by -1, but it feels cumbersome. Because this calculator enters whole expressions instead of one-number-per-operation like simple calculators, you may not have as much need for the \"change sign\" function. For me, it is natural and I often like to see partial results as I go. So if the calculation is for example: 66 / (1 - (grams / molar mass)), it is natural for me to first calculate grams / molar mass (showing me the moles of a substance), then \"Change Sign\" and add 1, then invert the answer and X 66. So \"change sign\" and \"invert\" go hand-in-hand for doing a computation \"from the inside out\" with minimum parentheses. It is also a useful skill in case you find yourself with a simple calculator on occasion. The Casio has the (-) key, but as yet I haven't found it more useful than the minus key. Maybe someone can explain it, the manual doesn't elaborate.Update: somehow I missed the \"Ans\" button next to the \"=\" key. So not a single button push, but the \"-\" button followed by the \"Ans\" button will invert the sign of your answer and you can proceed from there. Also, the Ans button is needed for taking a function of your last answer, such as log(), etc. (unlike simpler calculators where log always takes log of last calculation). And \"alpha\" \"Ans\" will get you the \"pre-answer\", the answer before the last answer. So there is a two-memory stack at work for the answers.Update: another real weakness of this calculator is there is no (that I know of) quick way to change from fixed point to scientific notation. This is standard on many very basic scientific calculators. You can go through a cumbersome mode shift with shift keys, selecting precision, yada, but a single dedicated key is what is needed. If you have .00612 and want to quickly see it as 6.12x10^-3 or vice versa -- forget it. I think that is a serious omission, and hopefully there is another brand out there with that useful key for my next calcluator. Too bad.",

You can spend a lot more money on a scientific calculator, but you don't get that much of a boost for the money in terms of everyday numerical calculations, including integrals. Highly recommended.",

Although these codes are printed on the inside of the sliding cover; they are in a -TINY- font which requires both sharp eyes & bright light to read, after first sliding off the cover. I'd rather reach for my tablet or phone to do the conversion. Given this usability failure I re-boxed & returned it.(Oddly, another selection function on this calc uses paged lists to help select the proper item, but metric conversions don't have this option. Any argument that the id numbers are used in programming sequences is entirely without merit. There is an similar Sharp calculator for which it's manual describes a paged conversions selection option.)",

It's a very wide angle so it gets a lot of the room in the frame too.If you don't like that the wide angle includes a lot of the room in the frame another cool feature of this webcam is the free software from their website which allows you to zoom the camera up on where you want the frame to be along with a bunch of color and exposure options.The microphone is the only downside about this camera I've found so far. In Windows it lists it as a \"1 channel 16 bit 16,000 Hz (Tape Recorder Quality)\" microphone. When I recorded and played back some audio in the Windows camera app it doesn't sound great either. Kind of like a muffled sound talking through an old telephone. For zoom calls it works though and for now it will keep me from adding another cord for a microphone.I really do appreciate that this camera comes with a physical privacy guard and lights to indicate when the camera is plugged in (red) and active (green). With devices that are always connected to the internet it's better to be safe than sorry and a physical control is something that no one can control over the internet.That being said I'd still like to see a physical switch for the microphone in the future.",

Came with a manual, the camera itself that has a USB cord, and the privacy protector. Camera looks very pretty and sleek. The attached USB cord is approximately a little more than 3ft long, which is a good length. The privacy protector has a sticky side where you can stick onto the top of the camera as shown in my pictures. Video quality is a lot better than I expected, so it was a plus! I haven't used the mic yet, but it sounded good during my testing. I will update once I get a few uses out of it.",

For example, it will work for an hour and a zoom meeting but then when I switched to a teams meeting it stops working. Sometimes, unplugging it and re-plugging it works. But not always. For that reason, I would not recommend buying it unless there’s some type of user error but I can’t imagine what I’m doing wrong. Also, given my set up, I would prefer the camera to be more in the middle, as opposed to at the top of the monitor. In hindsight, I would pick a different camera set up so that it would not sit on top of the monitor.",

When I can get Zoom to start up, I've also noticed a lag when using the share / stop sharing screen feature. I've tried deleting and reinstalling apps, updating the preferences on my Mac to recognize the camera, scouring the user manual, and even reached out to my work IT team to see if our internal security was blocking access to the camera.

I had an offsite work meeting with several colleagues and the room's fluorescent lights caused rolling bands of interference. Of the eight of us using webcams in the room, the NexiGo was the only one with a fluorescent light issue. I took off a rating star because of this. Otherwise the picture is super sharp.Also, the built in mic is poor.

Both of those started giving me all sorts of errors and I couldn't fix them so I figured it was a driver/software issue. It really wasn't, the cameras themselves broke down. I've only had this one a little bit so I was super happy that I just had to plug it in and it worked and that was it.It sits almost comfortably on my monitor, but it doesn't sit snugly on my monitor so the slightest shaking of my desk can create some motion in the camera. Not really an issue for me, but worth noting.It has a privacy cover which I truly enjoy because I get paranoid about the camera still being on.Video quality is alright, I notice mine is better than most people in my zoom meetings so if I had to make a statement, I'd say it's better than standard laptop cameras and/or most cheap cameras people would buy. Auto color adjustment on it is whatever, but that may also be Zoom and Teams and nothing to do with the camera. There is some grain in my camera, but I also use a 1920px monitor so I'm not too shocked because if I really wanted crystal clear photos or videos I highly doubt anything in this price range can do it.All in all, this does what you expect it to, and want it to and comes at a great price. I would buy again.",

Though after installing the software for it, it reacted... less than expected in OBS. The screen tore, it flashed green and red, then stopped working. It also tries to hijack your audio settings from time to time if you apps like discord.The positives however are there. It has a large wide view lens that can cropped in the software, it controls contrast and other features too, and fits snug on the monitor. The little lens cap attachment is a nice plus for you tech minded individuals out there. All in all? Not bad. Plus same day shipping was absolutely correct. Arrived perfectly on time. What more could you ask for in a bargain webcam?",

I had tried using other brands of mic and or camera through a cheap docking station with no success (connecting to a typical dell latitude corporate laptop) with a thunderbolt connector.This one was true to its word; I didn't have to install or set up anything. I connected it to the USB 3.0 output on my docking station and the audio worked immediately. The camera took me changing in a setting in webex to get it to find this camera (which was there, just not set to default). Teams automatically used the new camera. I can't figure out how to use the camera outside of those two programs, but I don't need to anyway, so that's not a problem for me.The microphone sounds great and people can still hear me clearly when I turn my head from side to side or reach to the desk beside me to use my home PC. As long as my head is pointed in the general direction of the thing and within a few feet of it, all is well.",

The native camera in my computer always turned every shirt in wore, with the exception of white, to purple. Don’t get me wrong, purple is a great color, but I don’t want customers to think I only own white and purple shirts!The NexiGo camera instantly became the default camera and was crystal clear across the three different web meeting platforms I use. Normally, I have a grainy image that makes my bald white head shine through as the dominant feature in an otherwise dark video.For my day job, the computer is provided for me and all of my meetings are for that job only, so I can blame image quality on them as my colleagues are in a similar situation and none of us look good. For my consulting job, it is my personal computer that is used and bad image quality reflects poorly on me as a specialist that they paid to see and hear.I use dual monitors and prefer to work off of the larger monitor that does not have a camera. Well, it does now and I no longer have to look like I’m taking to the side when I use that monitor. I don’t move around a lot to best utilize the capabilities of the autofocus feature, but from where I sat for my first meeting, everything was in perfect focus.Not that I need another one for my day job, but I seriously want to buy another after my initial experience with this one.",

It is gel-like in your hand but it will obviously slide off if you wait a couple seconds then tilt your hand.The smell is exactly like the other aloe hand sanitizer brands.Price: $18.87 (-20% for spending over $50) so it was 15% $2.51 per bottle.If you include 5% off from the Amazon credit card, it is $14.15 and $2.35 per bottle.It is 12 oz, it takes 3 of them to make one of the name brand \"big\" bottles which are 36oz. 3 of the smaller Amazon sanitizers would be $7.05.Good luck finding a name brand 36oz bottle of hand sanitizer for $7.05.Amazon wins again.",

I knew when I saw it on Amazon that it was a good value and I was happy with purchasing this but now that I actually have it , I'm so thrilled with the hand sanitizer. Six big 12 oz size bottles and packaged very well, with a box inside a box. I will be giving my son some of these since it's so much of it that this will last me for quiet a long time but now I'm thinking about purchasing this again because this is a terrific value!",

The residual and distinct fragrance smell is very persistent, though admittedly not going to be vivid for people who can tolerate/wear cologne or use Axe body wash and such. I cannot handle these synthetic fragrances. This one is strong enough to almost cover the alcohol smell. I immediately washed my hands 3 times with soap and rinsed like 6 times and could still faintly smell this scent residue Just couldn't get it off. I had to eat finger foods right after and it was pretty disturbing to not be able to get the musky smell off. If I wanted overtly scented sanitizer I wouldn't buy something called \"basic.\" I avoid the flashy colorful hand sanitizers that typically have distinct fragrance for the reason of my sensitivity. Never had a problem with the plain original Purell in the past or even the one from the Dollar Tree. Leaving on a trip this week and will have to stop at store for some, since I of course can't use this. I feel the name basic misrepresents this product. If you have even mild MCS or fragrance allergy don't choose this one.",
